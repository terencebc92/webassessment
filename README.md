## What did you like about this project?
The project gave me ample opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS -especially flexboxes and media queries- as the requirements were extensive. The project was also done under time pressure so I liked that I had to be as efficient as possible with my time and prioritize the tasks. Before writing the code for a given section, I also liked planning the layout and deciding how many flexboxes would be required for the content. 

## What did you struggle with in this project?
I struggled with spacing each content/div according to the requirements. It gets quite tricky when there are multiple items that all have paddings and the result is you have more padding that was originally intended. I also struggled with maintaining clean and understandable code while working on the project. As the stylesheet got larger and more classes were added, it became challenging to keep track of what styles have been applied, especially to parent classes. 

Additionally, I had mispelt a class selector in my stylesheet and I had to spend some time troubleshooting the reason why the style wasn't applying properly (I assumed I was using the wrong style property first. Maybe next time, I should check the syntax first before looking at the property).

## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I think the code writing process would have been more smooth if I spent some time before to analyse the sections, specify the requirements and detail these on the requirement sheet. These additional notes would have made it clearer for me so I don't have to second-guess myself while writing the code.
